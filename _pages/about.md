Hello! I'm **Yizhe Dai(Chris)**, a dual-degree student from **Shanghai Jiao Tong University - University of Michigan Joint Institute**. My academic journey represents a unique blend of engineering disciplines, transitioning from electrical and computer engineering(ECE) to industrial and operational engineering(IOE).

## Educational Background
ðŸŽ“ **Dual Bachelor's Degree**
- **Electrical and Computer Engineering** - Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2022.8â€“2024.8)  
- **Industrial and Operations Engineering** - University of Michigan (2024.8â€“2026.5)

My educational experience spans two continents and combines the rigorous engineering foundation from SJTU with the innovative operations research methodologies from U-M, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of both technical systems and optimization principles.

## Academic Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection of engineering and operations research, where I explore:
- **Supply Chain Optimization** â€“ Applying mathematical modeling to improve logistics efficiency  
- **Data-Driven Decision Making** â€“ Leveraging statistical analysis for industrial applications  
- **Systems Engineering** â€“ Integrating electrical engineering principles with operations research  
- **Machine Learning Applications** â€“ Using ML algorithms for optimization problems  

## Skills & Expertise
### Technical Skills
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, MATLAB, C++  
- **Optimization Tools**: Gurobi, CPLEX, Solver  
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Simulation Tools**: ProModel

### Languages
- **Chinese** (Native)  
- **English** (Fluent)  

## Research Experience
During my time at both institutions, I have engaged in various research projects that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical applications. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions to complex engineering and operational challenges.

## Future Goals
I am passionate about pursuing graduate studies where I can further explore the synergy between engineering principles and operations research methodologies. My goal is to contribute to the development of intelligent systems that can optimize real-world industrial processes.

## Personal Interests
Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, traveling, and learning about different cultures. My international educational experience has shaped my global perspective and enhanced my ability to work in diverse, multicultural environments.
